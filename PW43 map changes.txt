Afternoon -


So on one of the last days Dante and I sent through the maps that we used this year to see what had been updated and what needed updating. Â 


This is a summary of my notes. Â 


Dante - I may have missed something if you see something missing, please let me know to update these notes. Â 


We do have a few people who have volunteered to work on maps in the future - but that can be worked on as a future project after the final report is completed by the end of the month.
