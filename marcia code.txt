I've attached menu.css (definitions for the horizontal menu), pwnew.css (my class/id definitions as used below),
and nav.html (so you can see how my navigation menu is set up).  The menu supports additional sub-levels, if you want,
just keep nesting <ul>s under a <li>.  Also, you can display down arrows and right arrows to indicate which menu items
expand (I just disabled them by putting "x-" in front of them.)

If you have any questions about the code, please let me know.
