2007-01-09  * Rename file registered_groups_template to
		registered_groups_template.htm, change use in view_groups.cgi and .pl,
		update to pennsic 36 and use templates.
2008-02-14  * registered_groups_template.htm is called from view_groups.cgi,
		which is called from .htaccess when someone asks for
		view_groups_by_alpha.html .  If we want to write this file
		ourselves we need to (A) create the file whenever a group is
		registered, (B) safely so that if it dies in progress we don't
		have half a file, and (C) remove the line from .htaccess so it
		isn't redirected anymore.
2009-06-24  * Write php version of view_groups.cgi (to fix "500 server error"
		under firefox only)
            * update .htaccess to point to the correct view_groups file, delete
		extraneous crap
            * Copy templates/, css/, includes/, image/ to here from land_php
		subfolder, update paths.
2009-06-30  * Told that we are showing old version of system at this directory,
		move irrelevant crap to OLD_CRAP and write a redirector to the
		right place here.
