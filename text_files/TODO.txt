Huge list from 2006-12-29:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Some A TITLE tags would not be amiss to explain what the link is going to do in other parts of the website.  As you come across any link that is unclear, either clarify the text, add an explanation next to it, or put an A TITLE tag as a help to the user.

* Changes on the View All Users page: what order is this page in?; there are people on this list who are no longer land agents, we should delete them; what are all those TEMP_nnnnnn records and can we get rid of them?; why is everyone in the world have a Time Registered of Dec 31, 1969 at 19:00?

* Changes on the User Details page, gotten to by clicking on a user name in the All Users page: reformat it to be more readable and shorter.

* Changes on General Group page 2, details of a group: what's the big empty textbox for?; all the true/false fields at the bottom are labeled "example: 1 or 0" but actually contain "T" or "F", how about having them be either checkboxes or a Yes/No select box?

* Changes to Onsite View: what is this page for, in the first place?  If it's needed at all, reformat it so that the "neighbors" column is readable and so that it doesn't make each row three inches tall.  can't we create this same data by grouping each "final location" together and only showing the address data of each contact person once, rather than reproducing it for each row?  Or is the point that this page is in order by groupname so you can find the group, but has that group's neighbor's contact person's info?  And if so, wouldn't it be better off replaced by a group-to-block index in group order followed by a block-contacts list in block number order?  This is probably a question for Angus.

================================================================================
Ideas for changes, from Angus, 2007-01-16

* re-name a camp, from the admin page, without removing their seniority

* "is this still your address" commentary on main page

* check for accounts that are no longer used, contact owner, then delete them

* check for multiple accounts by the same person, delete the unnecessary ones

* allow user to mark account as "please delete me"

Unfortunately making that field a different type of number, is a huge deal.
Especially since it's referenced in so many different places by different
kinds of program (javascript, sql, perl).

A 1% change is 2 and a half square feet per person, which is just about
what I take up sitting down.  Are you really finding that you want to
change a group by less than that?
:-)

If you really find you need this, put it on the list for next year, but
it's not simple enough for me to attempt it before Pennsic.

- Corwyn

Hello,
 
:-)  Now I am really disappointed in you!  :-)
 
Okay, I understand.  However, when a camp is large and they are willing to compress, a 1/2% compression over 30 or 40 people adds up fast.  :-)
 
Please add it to your "for next next year" list but it will still be a lower priority.

[description of the Percent Increase from Last Year report]

-TO BE APPLIED FOR NEXT YEAR-

I want to be able to PRINT this letter from the Land program site.  The letter will need to be altered some so that when it is generated the camp name and camp size information is pulled from our records to go into it.  When the following year starts the camp(s) that received a letter should still be flagged somehow noting that they were warned.  Then if they grow again by (Some factor to be determined) they can be the first to move.  If they have not grown, or shrank, it should be indicated somehow.

If you have questions or would like things cleared up some please let me know.  Emerson, I CC you so you can make note of this and add your suggestions or other comments.

Corwyn, just note for the time line that sending these letters would be a function that would happen AFTER the Land allotment letters are sent out and a printed copy would go into the camps land packet at Pennsic.

Angus 
=========================================================================================
Regarding this task, the pre-reg numbers are stored in the history (except last year, P35, which I know I need to fix), so this information should be easily accessible even from on the system (e.g. on the block details view of the make-decisions page) as opposed to needing to be only in Excel.  Obviously an extract of all the groups whose growth is higher than N% is also possible and is more in keeping with what you're asking Finn for.

- Corwyn
=========================================================================================

1) some groups will have one land agent for multiple groups, sort of like
a conglomerate.  Want an option to indicate that the land agent is for
than more than one group and if so, drop down a table with the list of
groups that the land agent is working for. (Willow Point NA is an
example)

2) Land Agent Survey - eLeri has a template - will post to yahoo group

3) pictures/satalite photo (broken down in to blocks) with link and then
overlay with Pennsic map

4) contact Land Office -> new page with form that is then emailed to
respected person has block drop down and date stamp, if not a land agent

5) (done)

6) (done)

7) end date for all emails - Land1 can turn on and off?

8) rule read confirmation - confirmation sent to Land1

9) new/important rules bolded

10) Listing of rules and SOP that are used in land allocation

11) pre-reg caps - land agent set value - default to 999 (unlimited)

12) more transparent spam blocking in posted email addresses (store
emails on the back side (code/db))

13) link to page with area calculations for different shapes

14) system to provide possible camp layout based on block size and camps
location and sizes

15) wooded area calculations (fully wooded and partially wooded areas)

Yeah.  I am guessing it asked me to create it, even though I went through
the process for an existing group. I am able to use it just fine.

Likely a non-fatal bug, where it askes to add the group, even though its
the process for "re-activating" an existing group.

Ahhhhh.  That makes sense.  The check for whether you already have a group
is done earlier, when you try to go to the register-groups page, which you did
twice at once.

I'll have to add something to check for that.

Yes, we've been getting that message a lot, especially for long-standing
groups: it means the Coopers set your group up to receive campers even
before you registered your group.  I have it on my list to make that
message look less like an error, but I haven't gotten to it yet.  My

I've just checked, and yes, your group is registered now, both on the Land
Admin system and on the Coopers system.  Please let me know if there's
anything else I can do for you.

Greetings all,

We are at 559 camps
Most camps are down in numbers.
57 have increased but is it really only by a few people each.
There are 49 new camps.
Only Vlads still have over 100 people.

Corwyn, can this information be generated in a list at the bottom of the Land on view?  Low (but curious) priority.

All three leftover kingdoms have now registered.  On that subject:

The following groups named "*populace*" have not registered:
      Ealdormere Populace
      Populace of Caid
      Meridies Populace
(and I would like to rename all these groups to Populace of X not X Populace,
please let me know if you think this is reasonable)

I think this is a good idea.  Make the changes but hold onto them until AFTER Pennsic is over so that a note can be added to the registration page that all these camps have been change to "Populace of X"

The following groups named "*Barony*" have not registered:
      Barony of Hidden Mountain
      Barony of Ramshaven
      Barony of White Waters
      The Barony of the Flame
(and I would like to rename the last group without the word The, please let
me know etc etc)
If Barony of the Flame does register then please ask them letting them know that all the other Barony groups have made this basic change.

The following groups named "Shire*" have not registered:
      Shire of Coppertree
      Shire of Dragonsmark
      Shire of Eisental
      Shire of Spiaggia Levantina
as well as
      Caer Adamant
      Hartshorn-dale
(and I would like to rename these groups with the words Shire Of, though
there may be other shires whose names I don't happen to recognize)
Caer Adamant is registered as Shire of Caer Adamant.  So the "Caer Adamant" group can be deleted.
I may send a note to Hartshorn-dale.  However, I cannot go chasing down every group.  We both know groups come and go.  Notice there is no longer a Silver Rylle camp.

No groups named "Canton*" have failed to register.  In fact, no such groups
exist at all.

yes, I know now that those were the planned cutoff dates, but what the
system thinks is that group registration would cut off on 6/15.  We've also
been advertising this date to all land agents all year: the main page of
the website has said "welcome so-and-so, you haven't chosen a group,
registration closes 6/15" every time anyone logs on since January 1st.

<< Okay this is a correction to be made for next year.  We really cannot

Therefore I'm planning to keep allowing groups to register until that date,
rather than suddenly cutting it off earlier than I've been telling people I
would.  The person registration deadline is not under my control, so it
stays 6/15 as well, and I don't see how this affects anyone at Coopers Lake
because I've automated the creation of the groups on their side.

<< Okay.

You are correct, we've had quite a lot of that this year.  It seems that
unlike last year when Fred cleared out the database of camps from his site,
this year he left in all the groups from last year.  So there are a few
groups that have people registered to them that nobody has signed up as
the land agent for.  From page Clean Up Prereg Count:

Group Name              People      On-site Rep Name
Clan of the Arctic Winds      1     Michael Kiefer
House Fabri             2     Cadifor Cynan
Iron Cross              2     Cynthia Sues
Lochleven               52    Matt Adwin
Mirage Forest           9     Benjamin T Zonker
-----
Individual Camping            11
Landgroup not Listed          22
None Selected           17
Not filled in                 52
MERCHANT                50
RV CAMPING        9

Note: I have sorted these differently than would show on the webpage.  The
top five are real camps that have campers but no land agent.  Freehold and
Coldwood was in this list until recently, when their land agent did register
them.  The bottom six are actually administrative groups that shouldn't have
a land agent, which I am going to work on marking them as such so that we
can give them an imaginary land agent so that they don't show up in this list.

Does anyone have an idea as to what we should do about these last few
groups?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
things I don't know what they mean:
	NOTE: admin_generate_landone_view: some of the records printed in that list, don't appear in the master list: they must be pulling from somewhere else.  Example: Kingdom of AnTir vs. Kingdom of An Tir.  Update: I have no idea what that note means.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO:
	deal with people in fictional groups (None Listed), find them homes: produce a tool that shows this list of groups in a helpful way
	
	admin_view_all_users: show groupname of group I'm responsible for, if any; add link allow editing of group info "EDIT groupname"; rename link in first column to "EDIT username"
	
	Jan 1 button: record this year's land agent id in a previous_user_id field right before you zero out this year's user_id.
	
	NEXT YEAR: possible newsgroups for each block discussion?
	
	Must flag groups with a land agent but no campers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS INVOLVING SCHEMA CHANGES:
	create flag "system_camp" on land_groups, default false, set to true for e.g. MERCHANT.  System camps are neither registered nor unregistered, they are a separate class of thing.  Do not allow people to choose system camps in the camp registration list.  Automatically register all system camps with the Coopers on Jan 1st.  Sort the camps-without-land-agents thing by system camp vs. not system camp.  Automatically link a fake land agent record to all system camps on Jan 1st?  Or, automatically delete all fake land agent records on Jan 1st.

I think this is fine.  They would all be saved as soon as they came in.  It will
give us a record so that we can say "Yes, Your Grace we did send you your Land
assignment, I have a copy of it here."
 
CC should be fine.  Then the Land Agents will see that we have been included.
 
Emerson what are your thoughts?
 
Angus
================================================================================
Is there a way that they can be cc'd to a file on the admin section of the
land site so we can access them without having all the emails come in?
Some sort of archive that we can print them from if we need them?
Actually, an archive of all the land related emails would be great as it
would give us a historical file to refer to as needed in the future.
================================================================================
Actually, there *IS* an archive of all emails that were ever sent by the
mail merge tool, possibly only starting last year?, there just isn't any way to get to them
presently.  If you would like me to add an interface that lets you see those emails, I
can do that with no problem, it'll just be a bit of work.  Just let me know.

If we want a log of "we sent canned email X to person Y at time Z", I can probably create that more simply.  Just let me know what it is that we need.
================================================================================
Speaking personally, I don't think I need the cc's for this year.  Having
the ability to pull the information would be a good to have in the future.

From 2008-07-15:
================================================================================
Greetings Corwyn et al,  :-)

Can notes about the blocks be added to the   admin_generate_decide_block&block_id=   type pages?  For example on N19 they have a structure that is permanent and is there with permission of the Coopers.  If a New Land Staff was made and told them to take it down because it is too tall they would complain.  But, if the block info had a note on it state when the structure was made, how tall, who gave the permission, etc. it could help.

Same with bridges that are too old. The note could say bridge torn down PWX after winter damage.  Coopers gave permission for new structure.  Bla bla bla...

Comments, anyone?

Angus
================================================================================
Garowyn also had this idea.  Last year she created a book that with
information, by block, about decisions that have been made.  I was filling
it in last year with as much information as I had and adding decisions that
were made at Pennsic.  Having this available as an on-line resource would
be even better.  A paper copy could be printed to bring to Pennsic for all
the land staff to see.  When any of us go out for a 'service call' we have
the records of what has happened in the past with the block.  A very good
resource for us to have.  We could potentially also include pictures of
structures too.  That way we can see if anything has changed.

Emerson
================================================================================
I can bring my camera and if Corwyn does not mind doing the work during Pennsic the images could be uploaded on site.

Could or should Land agents have access to some of this info like the images of the structures?

Angus
================================================================================
With everything we have going on, I don't think we need to load them up on
to the website while on site.  It can be a post-Pennsic project.

I'm not sure why land agents would need access to the photos.  I'm sure
they have lots of photos that they've taken of their site.

Emerson
================================================================================
Regarding the following change:
	* edit_group_information (regular): the instructions say that people who want X blocks should enter "Other" as their first choice, whereas we really want them to enter the X block if they can see it, and "Other" only if this is a new relationship and the X blocks don't show up in their list.  Fixed instructions.
Verify that the instructions on new_evaluate_group_name are similarly corrected.

it worth automating the process, in your opinion?

When auto-creating groups in admin_cleanup_prereg_count, make sure that you move them into their chosen block, if that time has passed, rather than leaving them in block "".  Also, when creating a fictional user, set their sca name to "admin account", as opposed to being set to "".
================================================================================
Why does registering a group, set that group's final location to "", even if it had already been set correctly?  Was I resetting this to "" because the global set-everyone-to-"" at Jan 1st had not yet been written?
================================================================================
The list of land administrators should be a flag on the user, not a hard-coded list in the program.  Maybe have a fallback-admin-if-we-lose-all-our-admins user hardcoded, but certainly not the entire list.

================================================================================
I am thinking that for next year when a Land Agent is signing up their camp they should be listed this way in all locations.  So as they are filling in their name it should be labeled as Land Agent information.  On the page that currently says onsite contact, that too should read Land Agent and the name should auto fill in from when the persons name was filled in the first time.

auto-change land agent (request replacement by old land agent, accept change by new land agent)
================================================================================
always allow creating users, but forbid linking to groups if we're closed.  also warn this is the case on the create-user page so you dont create a user uselessly.  after creating an account go to main page either unconditionally or optionally.
================================================================================
admin prereg list: add details to changed=yes i.e. Add, Moved in from X, Refund, Moved out to X, etc.  Therefore on landone-view and block-details, allow linking 0 people so we can see their history, possibly only if there is any history.
================================================================================
cutting off making number changes: when do the coopers print the paperwork that says where each person is camping?  we need to cut off moving people earlier than that.  we also need to cut off downloading new cooper data at that point.  is this a date, or is this a new mode (groups locked) that starts when a button is pressed immediately prior to pennsic sometime?
================================================================================
block details page: the first choice is often blue, even when for other groups in the same block it's green.  Are we colorizing based on whether the group would fit AGAIN into the block?  Based on sizes of camps with blue vs. green links, it seems that we are.
================================================================================
group labels: need to be grouped by block, then alpha by group name; need only block name and group name, not land agent name or on-site-rep per Emerson.  "With Emerson  N03".  CSV export?  PHP/PDF ?
================================================================================
next year, be sure to label each email with the block number and sort them by block then oldest in back to youngest in front.  they need to be that way in the land one box
================================================================================
blocks with only one or two groups in them: select block_name, block_id, count(*) as num, min(group_name) as first_group from land_blocks inner join land_groups on(block_id = final_block_location) group by block_id having num <= 2 order by block_name
