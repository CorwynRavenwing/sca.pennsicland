<h2>Land Agent Procedure Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read all information on the Land pages, and look closely at the maps since the blocks
may have changed from last year.
<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>
<li>Register your group.
<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>
<li>The Land Office will e-mail Land Agents their block assignments on July 7.
If you do not receive a notice by then, contact Land Staff.
<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>
<li>Once you get your block assignment, contact the other Land Agents also assigned to your block.
Try to work out which area of the block each group will camp in prior to arrival at Pennsic. This
has worked well in the past and saves everyone time on Land Grab day.
<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>
<li>Troll opens on Friday, July 25th at <strong>12 noon</strong>.
No one will be allowed onto the battlefield or into the campground without going through
Troll first. Do not arrive
prior to <strong>noon</strong>; the staff will not be ready for you.
<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>
<li>After checking in at Troll, Land Agents walk to the Land Office (in the <span style="color:blue">Great Hall</span>) to get your land packets.
These will contain maps and any final instructions for completing the land process. Once you have your packet,
you can look at your land and talk to the Land Agents from your block. The Land Office will be open Friday,
July 25 from noon until 11:45 pm and on Saturday, July 26 from 6:00 am-8:45 am. <b>You must check in with Troll
and the Land Office by 8:45 am on Saturday.</b>

<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>

<li>You will be allowed to camp Friday night on the-battlefield / parking lot.
NO camping will be allowed inside the campground, except for staff members.

<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>
<li>All Land Agents must sign one block map indicating where their group is camping. You will also be required, if so noted on your block assignment email, to set aside unallocated land in your block for single campers. Single camper space must be clearly shown on the map. Single campers must have clear access to a main road.  Registered groups may not save single camper space for people arriving at a later date.

<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>

<li>
If you cannot come to an agreement on group placement on your block, submit your block to Land Staff for binding
arbitration.

<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>

<li>Your final approved map will be used for: informational purposes; to resolve disputes; and by the Public Safety department.

<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>
<li>Once the block map has been approved, you and all your party who have gone
through Troll will receive authorization to drive into the campground.
<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>

<li>Rope off the perimeter of your land allocation and post your camping authorization form at the entrance in
 a waterproof container. Note: It is important that you rope off your encampment as it makes it easier for
single campers to find unused land left in a block.


<div style=" line-height:.5" ><br></div>
<li>Once all this is finished, set up your camp and enjoy Pennsic!
</ol>
