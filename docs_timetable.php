<h2>Land Agent Procedure Summary</h2>
<ol class="doublespaced">

<li>
	Read all information on the Land pages, and look closely at the maps since the blocks
	may have changed from last year.
</li>

<li>
	Register your group.
</li>

<li>
	The Land Office will e-mail Land Agents their block assignments on July 7.
	If you do not receive a notice by then, contact Land Staff.
</li>

<li>
	Once you get your block assignment, contact the other Land Agents also assigned to your block.
	Try to work out which area of the block each group will camp in prior to arrival at Pennsic. This
	has worked well in the past and saves everyone time on Land Grab day.
</li>

<li>
	Troll opens on <strong>Friday, July 29, 2016 at 9:00 am</strong>.
	No one will be allowed onto the battlefield or into the campground without going through
	Troll first. Do not arrive
	prior to <strong>9:00 am</strong>; the staff will not be ready for you.
</li>

<li>
	After checking in at Troll, Land Agents walk to the Land Office (in the Great Hall) to
	check in with the Land Office, pick up any additional information pertinent to your block.
	Bring your completed Camping Authorization Form and Block Map.
	Once you have checked in with the Land Office, you may walk your land and talk to the
	Land Agents from your block. The Land Office will be open
	Friday, July 29, 2016 from 9:00 am until 11:00 pm and on Saturday, July 30 from 8:00 am &mdash; 6:00 pm.
	<b>You must check in with Troll and the Land Office by 10:00 am on Saturday.</b>
</li>

<li>
	You will be allowed to camp Friday night on the-battlefield / parking lot.
	NO fires are permitted on the battlefield.
</li>

<li>
	All Land Agents must sign one block map indicating where their group is camping. You will also be required, if so noted on your block assignment email, to set aside unallocated land in your block for single campers. Single camper space must be clearly shown on the map. Single campers must have clear access to a main road.  Registered groups may not save single camper space for people arriving at a later date.
</li>

<li>
	If you cannot come to an agreement on group placement on your block, submit your block to Land Staff for binding
	arbitration.
</li>

<li>
	Your final approved map will be used for: informational purposes; to resolve disputes; and by the Public Safety department.
</li>

<li>
	Once the block map has been approved, you and all your party who have gone
	through Troll will receive authorization to drive into the campground.
</li>

<li>
	Rope off the perimeter of your land allocation and post your camping authorization form at the entrance in
	 a waterproof container. Note: It is important that you rope off your encampment as it makes it easier for
	single campers to find unused land left in a block.
</li>

<li>
	Once all this is finished, set up your camp and enjoy Pennsic!
</li>
