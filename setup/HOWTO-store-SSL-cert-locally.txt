# yesterday I received this error message:
#	git pull
#	"fatal: unable to access" "SSL certificate problem: unable to
#	get local issuer certificate"
# 
# Googling the error, it was suggested that we host the SSL cert locally:

mkdir ~/certs
curl http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem -o ~/certs/cacert.pem
git config --global http.sslCAinfo "$HOME/certs/cacert.pem"

#	https-behind-firewall

# this fixed the problem.
