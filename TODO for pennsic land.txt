* create a group and register it, and determine why people aren't completing registrations

* possibly change history page so you can switch between person-count mode and block-assigned mode

* possibly allow email merges to "all half-registered groups"

* record previous land agent for block, don't overwrite until group is registered again by a different person

* prevent people from registering groups that are marked as "FORBID"

* warn groups that are not yet marked as "ALLOW", or perhaps only groups that are marked as "PROBLEM"

* ask Fred to return all groups that exist on his site, not just those with campers (return "0" for empty groups)

* ask Fred to disallow group names with special characters in them (OR) just don't create them ourselves

* help screens for every page that needs one
