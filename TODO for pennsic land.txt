* create a group and register it, and determine why people aren't completing registrations

* possibly change history page so you can switch between person-count mode and block-assigned mode

* possibly allow email merges to "all half-registered groups"

* record previous land agent for block, don't overwrite until group is registered again by a different person

* prevent people from registering groups that are marked as "FORBID"

* warn groups that are not yet marked as "ALLOW", or perhaps only groups that are marked as "PROBLEM"

* ask Fred to return all groups that exist on his site, not just those with campers (return "0" for empty groups)

* ask Fred to disallow group names with special characters in them (OR) just don't create them ourselves

* help screens for every page that needs one

================

Need a count of all groups, which do not have a "final location" but do have a camper count, to be displayed on the admin summary page, labeled "groups awaiting another press of the BRB" but only if the mode is correct to allow that.  not sure what to label them if that is not true.
