Land Allocation system for the Pennsic War of the SCA

Written 2003(?) to present by Corwyn Ravenwing,
        Webminister of the Pennsic War Land website.

This source code in PHP, is based upon (but is a complete
rewrite of) a previous version written in Perl/CGI,
which was written by a predecessor of mine in the office.
